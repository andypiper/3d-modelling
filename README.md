# 3D Models

Various 3D models for prints and other projects.

Still trying to get my head around different 3D modelling tools; primarily using OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, with a side of Tinkercad and Fusion 360.

I'm pretty active on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@AndyPiper) (at least as a consumer of other designs!) and post anything more broadly interesting there.

## Requirements

- [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org)
- [BOSL2](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2) library

## Useful additional projects

- [NopSCADlib](https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib) has a large number of components

... plus a variety of other things I play with to test and learn!
